# Nexus Learning — Project Memory

## What We Are Building
An AI-powered adaptive tutoring platform for K-10 students called Nexus Learning. It teaches math, science, and English through a hyperrealistic AI tutor character (Cosmo the Bear), adaptive curriculum generated by Claude AI, and a mastery-based learning system.

## Tech Stack
- Web: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn/UI
- Mobile: React Native + Expo
- Databases: PostgreSQL (Neon), Neo4j Aura, Redis (Upstash)
- AI: Claude API, ElevenLabs, HeyGen
- Auth: Auth0
- Payments: Stripe
- Email: SendGrid

## Current Status
Not started. About to begin full v1.0 build.

## Key Rules
- Read this file at the start of every session
- Update TODO.md after every completed feature
- Never commit API keys
- Cosmo the Bear is the MVP mascot — build him first before other characters
